This document provides some information to help you decide whether you would like to do so. Please take the time to read this information carefully and consider whether you wish to take part.

            <section id="purpose">
                <p><span class="lead">In this study</span> we are interested in understanding how the brain is organized, processes information and performs skills such as decision making. We can investigate this using computer-based behavioural tasks which are safe and non-invasive. Using many different techniques available on a computer program, we can gain information about human behaviour. We are interested in investigating the processes of decision making, and your confidence in those decisions.</p>

            <section id="procedure">
                <p><span class="lead">During this study</span> you will be performing computer-based tasks and will be asked to respond to stimuli appearing on the screen and to make those responses via mouse clicks.</p>

                <p><span class="lead">We collect data</span> on your performance during the study. Any information collected about you during this study will be kept strictly confidential. Any data (including task performance/questionnaire answers) will be anonymised with a code so that the results can not be linked back to you. All the data is kept on firewall and password-protected computers. Any personal information about you will be destroyed at the end of the study. Sometimes, new methods to analyze previously collected data become available after a study has ended. Therefore, we ask for your permission to use your anonymised data in future studies, and to share data with other researchers both inside and outside of the European Union. Responsible members of the University of Oxford may be given access to your data for monitoring and/or the audit of the study to ensure we are complying with relevant guidelines.</p>

The University of Oxford is the data controller with respect to these data. Your personal data are stored separately, and will not be linked to your performance. Your personal data will not be shared, and only responsible members of the University of Oxford will be allowed access for monitoring, audit, or server administration purposes.</p>
